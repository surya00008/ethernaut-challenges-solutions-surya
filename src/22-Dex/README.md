# Ethernaut Challenge 22 — Dex

The goal of this level is for you to hack the basic DEX contract below and steal the funds by price manipulation.

You will start with 10 tokens of token1 and 10 of token2. The DEX contract starts with 100 of each token.

You will be successful in this level if you manage to drain all of at least 1 of the 2 tokens from the contract, and allow the contract to report a "bad" price of the assets.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Drain all of at least one of the two tokens from the DEX by exploiting the pricing logic.

## 🔍 Initial inspection

Instance address:

```bash
DEX_SEPOLIA=0x69222B1ac7950bEc5fc46cB377D7B92c2834fb7f
```

### Check `token1`

```bash
cast call $DEX_SEPOLIA \
    "token1()(address)" \
    --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

Result:
`0xDA0d4bea0310335E5E770C1b7363d940029d49E4`

```bash
TOKEN1_SEPOLIA=0xDA0d4bea0310335E5E770C1b7363d940029d49E4
```

---

### Check `token2`

```bash
cast call $DEX_SEPOLIA \
    "token2()(address)" \
    --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

Result:
`0x2790F6027caA0B33f0336b5dDA144f3B86Cd1C58`

```bash
TOKEN2_SEPOLIA=0x2790F6027caA0B33f0336b5dDA144f3B86Cd1C58
```

### Check player balances

```bash
MY_ADDRESS=0xeCF94300dD67bB8c31F41BE3a2136D3f0abFb0B0
```

```bash
cast call $DEX_SEPOLIA \
    "balanceOf(address,address)(uint256)" \
    $TOKEN1_SEPOLIA $MY_ADDRESS \
    --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

Result: `10`

```bash
cast call $DEX_SEPOLIA \
    "balanceOf(address,address)(uint256)" \
    $TOKEN2_SEPOLIA $MY_ADDRESS \
    --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

Result: `10`

---

### Check DEX balances

```bash
cast call $DEX_SEPOLIA \
    "balanceOf(address,address)(uint256)" \
    $TOKEN1_SEPOLIA $DEX_SEPOLIA \
    --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

Result: `100`

```bash
cast call $DEX_SEPOLIA \
    "balanceOf(address,address)(uint256)" \
    $TOKEN2_SEPOLIA $DEX_SEPOLIA \
    --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

Result: `100`

---

### Check owner

```bash
cast call $DEX_SEPOLIA \
    "owner()(address)" \
    --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

Result:
`0xB468f8e42AC0fAe675B56bc6FDa9C0563B61A52F`

## 🧠 Vulnerability analysis

The swap formula is:

```text
amountOut = amount * (toBalance / fromBalance)
```

This is **NOT** constant product like Uniswap (`x * y = k`).

The price depends only on current balances, which you can manipulate.

We want to make the ratio:

```text
toBalance / fromBalance
```

very large.

---

## 🔁 Exploit strategy

To accomplish that, the idea is to **swap back and forth** the tokens so that one token balance gets drained.

Example:

1. Swap token1 → token2
2. Then token2 → token1
3. Repeat

Each time:

* one side decreases
* the other increases
* the ratio gets worse

---

## 🧪 Step-by-step example

Starting point:

```
DEX:
100 token1
100 token2

YOU:
10 token1
10 token2
```

Then:

```
1. swap 10 token1 → get 10 token2
   DEX = 110 / 90

2. swap 20 token2 → get 24 token1
   DEX = 86 / 110

3. swap 24 token1 → get 30 token2
   DEX = 110 / 80

4. swap 30 token2 → get 41 token1
   DEX = 69 / 110

5. swap 41 token1 → get 65 token2
   DEX = 110 / 45

6. swap 45 token2 → get 110 token1
   DEX = 0 / 90
```

---

### 🔍 What pattern should you notice?

The DEX keeps oscillating between shapes like:

* one reserve around 110
* the other reserve shrinking:
  `100 → 90 → 80 → 69 → ...`

More precisely:

* your balance increases every round
* each swap becomes more impactful
* one side eventually gets drained

---

## 🧪 Local test

We have created a local test file [DexTest.t.sol](../../test/challenge-22-dex/DexTest.t.sol) to simulate the exploit step by step.

---

## 🚀 Exploit on Sepolia

We executed the exploit using our automated Foundry script `script/22-Dex.s.sol` which automates all the required swaps to manipulate the reserve ratio and drains the pool.

Execute it using:
```bash
forge script script/22-Dex.s.sol --rpc-url sepolia --broadcast
```

### 📜 My Transactions

* **Final Draining Swap**: [0xb8810b53d2ddb655fd60be8c6211289841554d669d92f9d1628eeb7aef848215](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xb8810b53d2ddb655fd60be8c6211289841554d669d92f9d1628eeb7aef848215)
* **Final Swap Sequence Block**: 10933084

## 🛡️ Security Takeaways
* Pricing based solely on pool reserve balances is extremely unsafe and vulnerable to manipulation.
* Always enforce a constant-product model (like Uniswap's $x \times y = k$) to prevent complete drainage.
* Use decentralized, manipulation-resistant oracles (like Chainlink) or TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) models rather than local reserve ratios.
